### An (Incomplete) list of dependencies

+ Set `SPARK_HOME`
+ `pip install ipython scipy numpy scikit-learn findspark pandas pycapnp`
+ install graphlab (need code from Dato) __TODO__ This shouldn't be a dependency
+ When installing `capnproto`, don't install in home dir on millenium machines because they
  are NFS mounted, and permissions get messed up
